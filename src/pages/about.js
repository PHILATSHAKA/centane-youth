                    The youth is disillusioned; they no longer participate in initiatives, have lost confidence and are very different compared to their role in the past years on political struggle.  The organization is set to invite role models to take part, encourage and act as mentors and motivators to the youth.  Our long term objective is to ensure that youth understands the positive benefits of organizational involvement. The above will be achieved through partnerships with other stakeholders in the private and public sector.

                    Youth Rising Leadership Project focuses on coaching and capacity building of Grade 10 – 12 Learners to fully understand their potential whilst getting fundraising knowledge to boost their careers at institutions of higher learning. The National Development Plan research depicts a bad image of learners dropping out prior to them finishing secondary school and as well as not contributing to the South African economy hence a need for a focussed new breed of learners on their careers. Learners with no fundraising knowledge get trapped and are unable to enter tertiary institutions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Learners with no coaching do not find purpose in life and become immoral and endanger the society. It focuses on creating future leaders with vision and innovation from secondary to tertiary level with unending mission and vision.

                    In just 9 months after launch, we have managed to assist 24 matriculants from disadvantaged backgrounds to register at own institutions of higher learning in Eastern Cape and are now aiming at assisting 100 next year.
